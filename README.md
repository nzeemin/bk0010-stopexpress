# bk0010-stopexpress
Porting game Stop the Express to BK-0010, work in progress.

The game for ZX Spectrum was written by Hudson Soft and published back in 1983.
In 1990 the game was ported to Elektronika MS-0515 (PDP11-like computer based on T11 clone) by unknown programmer in Lwow (Ukraine).
In 2017 I ported the game to UKNC.
And finally in September 2018 I started porting the game to BK-0010 machine.
